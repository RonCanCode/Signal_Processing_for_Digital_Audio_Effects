# Impulse Responses

Impulse response measurements were conducted at  
Stanford's Memorial Church.  Various techniques  
were used including sine sweeps, golay codes,  
baloon pops, and noise bursts.

The IRs were then analised and refined using  
MATLAB.  Finally, convolution filtering was  
employed to create a reverb effect.
