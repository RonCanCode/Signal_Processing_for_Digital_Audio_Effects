# Signal_Processing_for_Digital_Audio_Effects

Coursework for MUSIC 424 / EE 367, offered at Stanford University, CCRMA.

From Stanford's Explore Courses website:

"Signal processing methods for audio effects used in music mixing and mastering. Topics: dynamic range compression, reverberation and room impulse response measurement, equalization and filtering, delay effects and distortion; digital emulation of analog processors and implementation of time varying effects. Single-band and multiband compressors, limiters, noise gates, de-essers, convolutional and feedback delay network reverberators, parametric and linear-phase equalizers, wah-wah and envelope-following filters, flanging and phasing, distortion. Students develop effects algorithms of their own design."
