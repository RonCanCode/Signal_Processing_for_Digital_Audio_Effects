# Critical Band Smoothing

Techniques were developed to simplify an impulse response.  
A warping function was defined to map frequency bins  
to perceptual ranges in human hearing.  The more sensitive  
to a set of frequencies we are, the more tightly the bins  
are spaced.  This warping is then used to smooth an  
impulse response using a moving average.
